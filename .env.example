# Google Gemini API Configuration
# SECURITY NOTE: API calls are now handled by the backend server
# The frontend no longer needs direct access to the Gemini API key
# This environment variable is kept for backward compatibility but is not used
# VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Backend Server URL
# For production, set this to your deployed backend URL
# Example: https://api.promptbattle.com
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001
